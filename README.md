My configuration files repository.

Why would I want my dotfiles on GitHub?

- Backup, restore, and sync the prefs and settings for your toolbox. Your
  dotfiles might be the most important files on your machine.
- Learn from the community. Discover new tools for your toolbox and new tricks
  for the ones you already use.
- Share what you’ve learned with the rest of us.

You don't need to configure anything manually. This works with a brand-new
machine from the factory as well as an existing machine that you've been
working with for years.
